            <h3>EPICS: Traffic Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>In Phoenix/Tempe area, the worst area for congestion according to the
              <a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/business/phoenix-has-2-of-the-countrys-worst-traffic-bottlenecks-study-says" target="_blank">ATRI</a>
              study is Interstate 17 at the intersection of Interstate 10, ranked 30th in the U.S. for traffic snarls.</p>
            <p>The bottleneck issue caused at the interstate can be monitored with aerial surveillance, and the analysis could further
              help in creating predictions to minimize the problem.</p>
            <p>Short term goal: To create a dashboard (single page web-application) using the knowledge of SQL database, React and Django that can  pull
              the data from different systems (Gridsmart, Miovision, Econolite, and ITS Plus) and display it collectively in one place
              giving the user an integrated platform for monitoring and analysing
              the traffic at every intersection throughout the city.</p>
            <p>Long term goal: Machine Learning and Adaptive Signal Control implementation in collaboration with City of Tempe using
                API Microservices, Machine Learning and openCV.</p>

            <h3>Intent Classification and Out of Scope Prediction</h3>
              <p>Chat-bots are designed for a particular task and implemented to have short conversations to get information from the user and
                helping them in completing the task. But most important factor is whether these dialog systems (chat-bots) perform well when a
                query falls outside their range of supported intents. NLP models cannot assume that every query belongs to system-supported
                intent class.</p>
              <p>In this project, I implemented and evaluated the performance of standard classifiers like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers),
              DialogFlow, MLP (Multi-Level Perceptron), CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), and SVM (Support Vector Machines) using Python and
              its libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn and TensorFlow in predicting out-of-scope queries as a part of Natural Language Processing project.</p>
              <p>The results proved that BERT and CNN provide good out-of-scope recall than the other classifiers. SVM and MLP classifiers
                improved the out-of-scope recall when the word embeddings like ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models) are used.</p>

            <h3>Evaluation of Semi-Supervised Learning Techniques Using Convolutional Neural Network</h3>
            <p>Semi-supervised learning is a combination of supervised & unsupervised learning which makes use of unlabeled data along with
              small amount of labeled data for training of a machine learning model.</p>
            <p>In this project, I implemented, tested and compared the classification accuracies, confusion matrices, and plotted the loss functions
              of various semi-supervised learning algorithms like Entropy Minimization, CutMix, and MixUp using Python and
              its libraries using Keras, TensorFlow, Pickle and Numpy.</p>
            <p>I have built machine learning models and analyzed the performance by applying various semi-supervised learning algorithms
              and varying the number of labeled and unlabeled samples using CIFAR 10 dataset.</p>

            <h3>Analysis on Large Scale Geo Spatial Data Using Apache Spark and Scala</h3>
            <p>The project is divided into two phases. In first phase I have setup environment and queries for Range, Range join,
              Distance, Distance join are developed. In the second phase of the project I have found hotspots for the given cabdataset using G score.</p>
            <p>I developed and implemented multiple spatial queries of large databases of taxicab firm which contains geographic data
              as well as real-time location data of customers using Hadoop MapReduce, Apache Spark and Scala.</p>
            <p>I implemented hot zone analysis and hot cell analysis and have found out significant hot spots using
              Apache Spark which can be of use to the cab companies like Uber, and Lyft to run more cabs in profitable locations.</p>
